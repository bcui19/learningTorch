# learningTorch
trying to learn torch because it seems really elegant and sometimes tensorflow is not the most fun thing to work with

Most of these modules are brought down from:

http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html

I generally put random comments where I think something is interesting in the moment, a lot of code isn't super modularized, but it can be easily made so 

Also I don't think a lot of these are minibatched properly, so minibatch size is 1; I also think this isn't too hard to fix
